## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` with at least:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key   # server/admin ops (never expose client side)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

If using Storage buckets or custom email templates, configure them in the Supabase dashboard.

## üöÄ Running Locally

```bash
# Install deps
npm install
# Start dev server
npm run dev
# Lint & typecheck
npm run lint
# (Add a build if needed)
npm run build && npm start
```

Visit: http://localhost:3000

## üß© Supabase Notes

- Uses separate helpers: `supabaseClient.ts` (browser), `supabaseServer.ts` (server components), `supabaseRoute.ts` (route handlers) to ensure the correct auth context.
- RLS policies should enforce row ownership (posts, comments, follows, notifications) & admin overrides via `is_admin` flag.
- Realtime notifications can be enabled by subscribing to changes (future enhancement).

---

## üõ° Security & Best Practices

- Avoid exposing `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` client-side.
- Enforce RLS on all tables (Posts, Comments, Follows, Notifications, Profiles, Likes).
- Rate limiting (future) recommended on auth + write endpoints.
- Image uploads: validate MIME & size (enhance route for production hardening).

---

## üß± UI Components

Key custom components:

- `follow-button` ‚Äì follow/unfollow state machine
- `notification-bell` + `notification-center` ‚Äì unread badge + list
- `post-interactions` ‚Äì like & comment quick actions
- `logout-form` / `logout-button` ‚Äì accessible logout with spinner
- Shadcn base components: `button`, `card`, `dropdown-menu`, `avatar`
